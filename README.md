##  <h2 align="center" >  Hey 👋, Im Asher Jacob  </h2>


<h3 align="left"> About me  </h3>
<p> I was first introduced to programming (C++) back in 2013 and since then my journey has been slow but it never stood still. It wasn't until 2019 when I started doing learning Web Development and that has certainly opened up several avenues to explore and grow as a developer. Joined the IT industry in Nov'20 and Im looking to constantly keep growing. </p>

👨‍🎓 Received corporate training in IBM Mainframes (z/OS, JCL, COBOL, DB2, CICS, REXX)

🔆 I find JavaScript really interesting and Im always looking to learn more on that

🔒 Blockchain is one tech that Im really passionate and working as a Blockchain Architect is a long term goal for me. (Buy Crypto)
